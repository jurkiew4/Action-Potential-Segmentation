# Action-Potential-Segmentation

3-28-2023

segmenter.py and spikedec.py work as separate files, but have been deprecated. Segmenter_w_GUI.py is a more refined program incorporating the same functionality
with GUI and more flexibility in choosing H5 files to segment. Still hard-coded for H5, but wider applicability will be added to the base file, while 
end-user tweaks remain simple.
